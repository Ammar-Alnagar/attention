# attention

Developed a robust transformer-based model leveraging the attention mechanism to enhance text classification tasks. The project involved implementing a transformer architecture that focuses on the most relevant parts of the input sequence, improving the accuracy of the classification model. Key aspects included preprocessing text data, fine-tuning the transformer model, and applying advanced attention techniques to capture the contextual relationships within the text. The final model demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy compared to traditional methods, making it highly effective for natural language processing tasks.
